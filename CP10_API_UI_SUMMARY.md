#### Air Quality Levels:
- 🟢 **Good (0-12 μg/m³)**: Safe for all activities
- 🟡 **Moderate (12-35 μg/m³)**: Sensitive individuals should take precautions
- 🟠 **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (35-55 μg/m³)**: Limit outdoor activities
- 🔴 **Unhealthy (55-150 μg/m³)**: Avoid outdoor activities
- 🟣 **Hazardous (150+ μg/m³)**: Emergency conditions

### 4. Multi-Location Support
- **Country selection** (currently Nepal, prepared for expansion)
- **City/Region selection** (currently Kathmandu Valley)
- **Scalable architecture** for adding new locations
- **Future-ready** for India, China, Bangladesh expansion

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- **Interactive visualizations** with Plotly
- **Real-time data updates** and processing status
- **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Mobile-responsive design** with custom CSS
- **Accessibility features** and clear information hierarchy
