# CP-7 Deep Models Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The deep learning models (PatchTST and Simple TFT) were producing NaN values in all metrics, indicating training failures.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing Issues**: The models were not properly handling the data preparation pipeline
2. **Training Configuration**: Models were trained with insufficient epochs (3) and small batch sizes
3. **Loss Computation**: Potential issues with loss calculation during training
4. **Evaluation Logic**: Problems with prediction shape alignment during evaluation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Data Preprocessing Improvements
- **Numeric Column Filtering**: Enhanced filtering to only use numeric columns for features
- **Target Scaling**: Proper StandardScaler implementation for target normalization
- **Sequence Creation**: Fixed sequence generation for time series data
- **Feature Engineering**: Added temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) when needed

### 2. Training Configuration Updates
- **Increased Epochs**: Changed from 3 to 5 epochs for better convergence
- **Batch Size**: Increased from 8 to 16 for more stable training
- **Learning Rate**: Maintained appropriate learning rates (1e-4 for PatchTST, 1e-3 for Simple TFT)
- **Patience**: Set to 10 epochs for early stopping

### 3. Model Architecture Fixes
- **Dynamic Initialization**: Fixed dynamic layer initialization based on actual feature dimensions
- **Patch Embedding**: Corrected PatchTST patch embedding for variable feature counts
- **Quantile Outputs**: Fixed Simple TFT quantile regression output handling

### 4. Evaluation Logic Improvements
- **Prediction Shape Handling**: Fixed shape mismatches in evaluation
- **Single-Step Prediction**: Used first prediction step for evaluation metrics
- **Target Alignment**: Proper alignment of predictions with actual values
