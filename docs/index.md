# AirAware Documentation

Welcome to the AirAware docs. This site covers the end-to-end PM2.5 nowcasting system including data flow, algorithms, architecture, and the codebase organization.

Use the left navigation to explore:
- Workflow: data → models → ensembling → API → UI
- Tech Stack: languages, frameworks, libraries
- Algorithms: Prophet, PatchTST, residual-based ensembling, bias learning
- Architecture: components, interfaces, deployment view
- Codebase: where things live and how to extend
