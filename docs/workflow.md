# Workflow

## Data pipeline
- Input: station PM2.5 measurements (joined 60-day window) at `data/processed/joined_data.parquet`
- QC: deduplication, clipping outliers, timezone alignment
- Weather: ERA5-Land via Open-Meteo with local caching and fallbacks

## Modeling
- Prophet (with tuned seasonality and ERA5 regressors)
- PatchTST (context-length 192, horizon 24; trained on rolling 60 days)
- Hourly Bias Learning (station Ã— hour smoothing)

## Ensembling
- Residual-based adaptive blending of Prophet and PatchTST
- Thresholded blending with weight floor; inverse-error weighting
- Tuned via 60-day backtest to minimize MAE

## Serving
- FastAPI service loads best artifacts (Prophet params, PatchTST best)
- Ensemble + uncertainty generation in `ForecastService`
- Streamlit UI displays forecasts, uncertainty, badges, and analysis

## Docker Workflow

### Development
```bash
# Start development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Features:
# - Live code reloading
# - Volume mounts for source code
# - Development tools included
```

### Production
```bash
# Build and deploy
docker compose up --build

# Services:
# - API: FastAPI backend
# - UI: Streamlit frontend
# - Processor: Batch job service
# - Docs: MkDocs documentation
```

### Management
```bash
# Use helper script
./scripts/docker_helper.sh build
./scripts/docker_helper.sh up
./scripts/docker_helper.sh logs
./scripts/docker_helper.sh down
```
